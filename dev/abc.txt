adding a new git repo under main repo tooling

Well I have done following.

1) created a new directory
2) cd into new dir. and then git init
3) cd ../; git add <new_dir_name>
4) git commit -m "message"
5) git push





----------------------
Submoduling from Wednesday has worked.
Verifying it now.
Steps followed

1) create a folder wednesday. and followed the sets in Submoduling.txt
2) now adding the tooling to wedndesday and pushed it into wednesday remote repository
3) Finally making changes to tooling, to see if changes can be viewed from Wednesday, after git pull in wednesday.


When I just did the git push, after making changes to dev/abc.txt
it was reject. Probably I need to pull before I make push
